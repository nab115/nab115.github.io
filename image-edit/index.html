        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Image-Edit (as the name suggests) is an image editing web application built in Spring using 
            Spring Boot and Spring MVC.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project was to begin learning the Spring framework and to challenge myself to take an
            idea and some requirements and build out a functional web application. With Image-Edit, a user can upload
            a JPEG image, crop it, and convert it to greyscale. The editing features are custom-built. For example, 
            I created draggable crop-lines using JavaScript which are limited to the bounds of the image and to eachothers
            opposing crop-line (e.g. the top line cannot be dragged above the top of the image or below where the bottom
            line has been placed). The Crop and Greyscale buttons call POST requests to the server which pass the
            relevant data (i.e. crop line locations relative to the image bounds) and recieve back the edited image.
        </p>
        <p>
            Image handling is done via a component with singleton scope which is autowired into the controller. 
            This Java class uses BufferedImage objects to hold the original image and the edited image, and it has 
            instance methods to take in the input from the upload and editing POST requests. The BufferedImage 
            representation of the transformed JPEG is then converted to a Base64 string which is inserted into the img 
            src inside of the HTML template using ThymeLeaf, so it can be displayed to the user.
