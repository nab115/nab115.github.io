                <h1 id="aboutTitle">About Naran</h1>
                <p id="about">I am currently a student at the University of Pittsburgh, 
                    majoring in Computer Engineering with minors in Math and Physics. I plan on graduating 
                    in the spring of 2018, and aim to be part of an innovative and challenging tech company 
                    upon graduation.<br>
                    My primary interests are in artificial intelligence and robotics. This past summer, while 
                    working as a technology intern at BNY Mellon in Pittsburgh, I also took an honors robotics 
                    course which especially piqued my interest in the field.<br>
                    Wanting to get more experience in robotics, I reached out to professors at the Robotics 
                    Institute at Carnegie Mellon. I was able to obtain a research internship for the current Fall semester in Dr. Maxim
                    Likhachev's research group, that designs and tests path planning algorithms.<br>
                    My background is very unique - I began school as a Physics and Math major. However, after two years I decided that my double major was too theoretical,
                    and I wanted to instead study something more practical. I experimented as an Economics and Math major for one semester, while taking my first Computer science
                    class - Intermediate Java. Though I enjoyed my economics classes, particularly the game theory course I took, I was drawn more to the computer science class.
                    I realized that computer science required a similar type of thinking as physics and mathematics, yet it could be used
                    to build and innovate. The very next semester I switched to Computer Engineering and haven't looked back.
                    I still love mathematically challenging work - I have taken my school's real analysis sequence for my math minor and am currently taking
                    Algorithm Design - an undergraduate/graduate course in designing and proving the correctness of algorithms. So far we have learned about proof by contradiction
                    for greedy algorithms, and are currently studying Dynamic Programming. I have loved every second of this class.<br>
                    Outside of school, I enjoy getting outdoors (Pittsburgh weather permitting....) to play tennis or golf. I also 
                    am a huge fan of the video game League of Legends.
                    Since my freshman year, I have been heavily involved in my fraternity - Delta Chi - and have gained so much from it 
                    including communication and teamwork skills, as well as lifelong friends.

                    and delivered sprint tasks using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also was a participant in an intern wide "strategic business challenge"
                    in which my group recieved first place for coming up with the best solution to improve employee engagement in BNY's employee resource groups.

                <p class="description">During the Fall of 2016, I worked at General Electric as a Edison Engineering Intern. I was placed in the Test Engineering group, and 
                    was tasked with fixing LabView test code. I also was able to experience a large scale manufacturing environment.

                <p class="description">During the Summer of 2015, I was accepted into the DOE-INFN program in Rome, Italy. This was a particle physics
                    research program where I got to work with real data coming from the large hadron collider. At the end of the program I was able
                    to travel to Geneva, Switzerland, the site of the LHC headquarters, and stay there for a couple weeks. Though this is one of the pinnacles
                    of the field of phyiscs, I realized that I didn't enjoy the work at all. It was extremely theoretical, yet I came to realize that 
                    I wanted to create and innovate, rather than work on something that I couldn't see or interact with. It just wasn't for me. This began a very
                    important journy into self discovery and ended up in me switching my field of study. I am so happy for this experience because it taught me
                    what I don't want to do, which I have come to learn is very important.

                    <p class="description">This past summer while working at BNY Mellon, I took an Honors course through Pitt's CS department
                        aimed at writing code in a real environment. We were assigned a partner, a laptop, and a Kobuki (which is essentially a rumba that we could manipulate through code).
                        We learned python and the ROS (Robotic operating system framework) framework, and used these tools to create algorithms to complete three projects.
                        The first project was simple : Command the robot to move an exact distance forward and backwards, or turn to an exact angle. This was
                        accomplished through the use of the robot's build in odometer. This project required us to create a velocity smoother, which would ramp up or slow down the robot
                        upon starting or stopping. Without using a smoother, the robot would jolt as it began to change speeds rapidly, cause the odometer
                        to give incorrect data. The second project was a line follower, for which we used a color detection library. The third project was to make the robot autonomously travel through the
                        hallways of one of the floors in the CS building. This required a very creative solution and A LOT of testing. For this project we were given an XBox Kinect,
                        which we used for distance detection. The easy part of this was to travel down a straight hallway. We simply balanced the distance of the object (wall) to the left and right
                        of the robot, turning slightly to make sure that these were always approximately even. The difficult part was to have the robot turn corners. To do this, we created a simple classification
                        algorithm for detecting a turn, and whether it was a right or left turn. Then, upon coming close enough to the corner, the robot turned at a constant speed (while moving forward) until it had passed the corner.
